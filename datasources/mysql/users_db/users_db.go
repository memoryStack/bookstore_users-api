/*
	this reason for having this kind of the structure is that in the "datasources" folder we can have
	different different types of the datasources for a microservies like "mysql", "nosql", "cassaderra" etc.
	and under a database we can have different tabels like "users" "e-mails" data etc etc.
	so this pattern is scalable.
